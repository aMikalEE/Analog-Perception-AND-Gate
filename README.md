# Analog-Perception-AND-Gate
This project implements a 2-input AND perceptron using operational amplifiers (op-amps) to perform analog logic. The circuit was designed, simulated in LTspice, and verified to match the expected AND gate behavior. It demonstrates weighted input summation, bias implementation, and op-amp comparator activation functions for analog signal processing.
